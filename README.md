# About
This SDK is meant to help users with basic queries to WattTimeâ€™s API (version 3), and to get data returned in specific formats (e.g., JSON, pandas, csv).

Users may register for access to the WattTime API through this client, however the basic user scoping given will only allow newly registered users to access data for the `CAISO_NORTH` region. Additionally, data may not be available for all signal types for newly registered users.

Full documentation of WattTime's API, along with response samples and information about [available endpoints is also available](https://docs.watttime.org/).

# Configuration
The SDK can be installed as a python package from the PyPi repository, we recommend using an environment manager such as [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
```
pip install watttime
```

If you are not registered for the WattTime API, you can do so using the SDK:
```
from watttime import WattTimeMyAccess

wt = WattTimeMyAccess(username=<USERNAME>, password=<PASSWORD>)
wt.register(email=<EMAIL>, organization=<ORGANIZATION>)

```

If you are already registered for the WattTime API, you may set your credentials as environment variables to avoid passing these during class initialization:
```
# linux or mac
export WATTTIME_USER=<your WattTime API username>
export WATTTIME_PASSWORD=<your WattTime API password>
```

Once you have set your credentials as environment variables, you can omit passing `username` and `password` when instantiating sdk objects. For instance, in the example below, you could replace the second line with

```python
wt_myaccess = WattTimeMyAccess()
```

# Using the SDK
Users may first want to query the `/v3/my-access` endpoint using the `WattTimeMyAccess` class to get a dataframe of regions and signal types available to them:

```python
from watttime import WattTimeMyAccess

wt_myaccess = WattTimeMyAccess(username, password)

# return a nested json describing signals and regions you have access to
wt_myaccess.get_access_json()

# return a pandas dataframe describing signals and regions you have access to
wt_myaccess.get_access_pandas()
```

### Accessing Historical Data

Once you confirm your access, you may wish to request data for a particular region:

```python
from watttime import WattTimeHistorical

wt_hist = WattTimeHistorical(username, password)

# get data as a pandas dataframe
moers = wt_hist.get_historical_pandas(
    start = '2022-01-01 00:00Z', # ISO 8601 format, UTC
    end = '2023-01-01 00:00Z', # ISO 8601 format, UTC
    region = 'CAISO_NORTH',
    signal_type = 'co2_moer' # ['co2_moer', 'co2_aoer', 'health_damage', etc.]
)

# save data as a csv -> ~/watttime_historical_csvs/<region>_<signal_type>_<start>_<end>.csv
wt_hist.get_historical_csv(
    start = '2022-01-01 00:00Z', # ISO 8601 format, UTC
    end = '2023-01-01 00:00Z', # ISO 8601 format, UTC
    region = 'CAISO_NORTH',
    signal_type = 'co2_moer' # ['co2_moer', 'co2_aoer', 'health_damage', etc.]
)
```

You could also combine these classes to iterate through all regions where you have access to data:

```python
from watttime import WattTimeMyAccess, WattTimeHistorical
import pandas as pd

wt_myaccess = WattTimeMyAccess(username, password)
wt_hist = WattTimeHistorical(username, password)

access_df = wt_myaccess.get_access_pandas()

moers = pd.DataFrame()
moer_regions = access_df.loc[access_df['signal_type'] == 'co2_moer', 'region'].unique()
for region in moer_regions:
    region_df = wt_hist.get_historical_pandas(
        start = '2022-01-01 00:00Z',
        end = '2023-01-01 00:00Z',
        region = region,
        signal_type = 'co2_moer'
    )
    moers = pd.concat([moers, region_df], axis='rows')
```

### Accessing Real-Time and Historical Forecasts
You can also use the SDK to request a current forecast for some signal types, such as co2_moer and health_damage:

```python
from watttime import WattTimeForecast

wt_forecast = WattTimeForecast(username, password)
forecast = wt_forecast.get_forecast_json(
    region = 'CAISO_NORTH',
    signal_type = 'health_damage'
)

```
We recommend using the `WattTimeForecast` class to access data for real-time optimization. The first item of the response from this call is always guaranteed to be an estimate of the signal_type for the current five minute period, and forecasts extend at least 24 hours at a five minute granularity, which is useful for scheduling utilization during optimal times.

Methods also exist to request historical forecasts, however these responses may be slower as the volume of data can be significant:
```python
hist_forecasts = wt_forecast.get_historical_forecast_json(
    start = '2022-12-01 00:00+00:00',
    end = '2022-12-31 23:59+00:00',
    region = 'CAISO_NORTH',
    signal_type = 'health_damage'
)
```

### Accessing Location Data
We provide two methods to access location data:

1) The `region_from_loc()` method allows users to provide a latitude and longitude coordinates in order to receive the valid region for a given signal type.

2) the `WattTimeMaps` class provides a `get_maps_json()` method which returns a [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) object with complete boundaries for all regions available for a given signal type. Note that access to this endpoint is only available for Pro and Analyst subscribers. 

```python
from watttime import WattTimeMaps

wt = WattTimeMaps()

# get BA region for a given location
wt.region_from_loc(
    latitude=39.7522,
    longitude=-105.0,
    signal_type='co2_moer'
)

# get shape files for all regions of a signal type
wt.get_maps_json('co2_moer')
```
