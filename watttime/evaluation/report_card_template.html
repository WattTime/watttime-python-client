Does the signal change across seasons as we would expect (e.g. weather often affects demand and renewable generation). You can pan left and right on the plots to see the full range of data."

It contains three elements: 1) A scatterplot of the relative differences between the modeled point_times against the mean of both modeled point_times. We expect to see the y axis of the scatterplot randomly (uniformly) distributed across all means. If there is a trend, it indicates that one model has biases at certain value ranges that the other model doesn't hold. 2) The reference line is the mean delta between the two models. The magnitude and direction of this line indicate if one model has large systemic bias when compared with the other. 3) 95% Confidence Intervals denote the area that we would expect all datapoints to be within if both models had the same bias. Note that in some cases it is expeccted for bias to change between models (e.g. systemic changes to the grid). A suitable explanation should be sought out if bias is apparent."

In addition to fuel types like natural gas, coal, and oil being marginal, interchange can also be a marginal fuel type. Interchange can represent either imports or exports. This plot shows a time series of the marignal fuel mix. It is helpful to look for diurnal and seasonal patterns, along with differences between models.

    {# Forecast Section #}

    <h2>Forecast Performance</h2>
    <p>Our modeled signal values produce real-time or historical outputs. To achieve AER impact while guaranting an acceptable charge rate / duty factor it is necessary to use a forecast to schedule electricity consumption or charging ahead of time. Our forecast models use traditional machine learning techniques to predict what the signal value will be ahead of time. Our forecast models tend to perform worse at further time horizons from the time they are instatiated. As such, we examine the performance of our forecast models at predicting the signal value over a variety of time horizons.</p>

Please note that this metric should be interpreted with caution, especially for signals with low variability. Rank correlation on a signal where variance is smaller than the noise is not going to give a meaningful metric. For instance, rank correlation could be zero but there's no loss in impact."

Each of these metrics could capture a different source of impact (e.g. solar curtailment may only be accessible to EV day charging). The 'simulation' simply looks at the cleanest timem to use electricity based on the forecasted value, and evaluates the impact of this against the historical signal value as truth. We also show the impact captured if the forecast was perfect by displaying the maximum possible impact if a 'perfect' forecast were used. These metrics assume that the modeled values are accurate, and only quantify the degree of error caused by the forecast model."
